# Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation (LDA) in one Function

**_TOPIC MODELLING via LDA_**

**This is an implementation of LDA with Collapsed Gibs Sampling**

*Note: To do topic modeling with methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation, it is necessary to build a Document Term Matrix (DTM) that contains the number of term occurrences per document.*

**Terms used :**

* tf : term frequency
* tf-idf : term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency
* dtm : document term matrix or term document matrix
